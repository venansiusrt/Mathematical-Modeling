# Mathematical Modeling Course 2018
This is my repository of Mathematical Modeling Course taken in Odd Semester of 2018. You can check and review if there are any mistakes in this simulation. In this repository, I used MATLAB R2015a. If you find some difference code or data structure, please check it first at www.mathworks.com.
## Autowasher Spring Vibration Problem
Bias spring resonance problems encountered during the development of the suspension for the F and P electronic autowasher "Gentle Annie" (1985). At 1100 rpm when the washing machine was in spin mode the bias spring would vibrate wildly and make contact with the pulley. In this project, we developed partial differential equation of wave's movement, you can check in the folder above.
## Tidal Waves
The objective of this assignment is to simulate the tidal wave in MATLAB. We first
consider the value of time as 1 and input some value of other variable (length of wave,
height of wave, initial condition for position, and initial position for speed). Each value
given to those variable is to find out how big their influence to the tidal wave.
## Heat Conductor
A copper conductor is sheathed in an insulator material. The insulator also stops heat from escaping. Imagine that the wire is hot after conducting electricity. We will model heat losses after the power is switched off.
## Arterial Blood Flow
Blood flow is a study of measuring the blood pressure and finding the flow through
the blood vessel. This study is important for human health. Most of the researches study the
blood flow in the arteries and veins. One of the motivations to study the blood flow was to
understand the conditions that may contribute to high blood pressure. Past studies indicated
that one of the reasons a person having hypertension is when the blood vessel becomes
narrow. I already gathered the useful references that can be used to make a mathematical model of arterial blood flow, however MALTAB simulation is not provided.
## Mid Exam
In Mid Exam problem, we have to model a rectangular membrane vibration. This is the development of two dimensional string problem. Equally important is its two-dimensional analog, namely, the motion of an elastic membrane, such as a drumhead, that is stretched and then fixed along its edge. MATLAB code and simulation are provided.
## Second Quiz
In this quiz, I made the simulation for Musical Instrument String Vibration and Skydiving Movement. Simulation report and MATLAB code are available.
## Final Exam
Final exam problem is about modeling electric potential and spreading dynamic model of contagious disease. MATLAB code, references, and simulation are provided.
