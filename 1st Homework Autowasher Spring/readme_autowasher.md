# Autowasher Spring Vibrations Problem
Bias spring resonance problems encountered during the development of the suspen-
sion for the F and P electronic autowasher "Gentle Annie" (1985). At 1100 rpm
when the washing machine was in spin mode the bias spring would vibrate wildly
and make contact with the pulley.
